<!--
  Google Search Console verification placeholder.
  Replace this file with the exact file Google provides when you choose the "HTML file" verification method.

  Example:
  - Google will ask you to upload a file named like: google1234567890abcdef.html
  - The file content will be a single verification string that Google provides.
  - Add that file to the repository root, enable GitHub Pages, then click Verify in Search Console.

  This placeholder is only an example and will NOT verify your site.

<!-- Example filename: google1234567890abcdef.html -->
<!-- Example content (replace with exact string Google gives you): google-site-verification: google1234567890abcdef -->
